# uos-detection-online-sexism

This repository contains the code used to train several transformer based models for two purposes.
The models range from Flan-T5, T5, Distilbert, Bert-Large.
The first purpose is flagging text as being sexist or not.
The second purpose is testing the type of sexism being demonstrated in a sexist text.

Additionally, there is code used to create augmented data for the purpose of exposing our models to more training data.
Finally, there is some code to test the different models.
